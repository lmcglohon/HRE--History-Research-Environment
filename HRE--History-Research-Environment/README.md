You need to have a Java Runtime Environment installed on your system.
 
HRE starts up blank, but can create an empty HRE H2 database for you.

Troubleshooting

If you get this error:

Unresolved requirement: Require-Capability: osgi.extender

Then you need to edit the Plug-ins tab on the Run Configuration, check org.eclipse.equinox.ds and click "Add Required Plug-ins".
